Getting started with Terraform

IaC - Provisioning infrastructure through SW to achieve consistent, repeatable and predictable environments

### Core Concepts

#### All Infrastructure resources  - Defined in Code
#### Store infrastructure related code in a Source control (Git)
#### Declarative vs Imperative - 
##### Imperative - If we want to create a Sandwich, if underlying language is imperative, we need to provide it with exact steps and assembling them together such as
     - Get ingredients
         - Get Bread
         - Get Vegetables
         - Get Potato
     - Assemble steps
        - Put vegetables within bread
        - Put potato in bread
        - Grill
