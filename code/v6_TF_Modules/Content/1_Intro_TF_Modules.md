# Terraform Modules
- What are terraform Modules?
    - Configuration that defines inputs, has resources and/or data sources and some outputs
    - When we create set of tf or .tf.json files in a directory, they are modules
    - Main configuration we work with is known as root module
    - It can invoke other modules to create resources
    - Modules can form hierarchy with root module at the top
    - Calling module - Referred too as the parent module and called module is the child module
    - Child module can be invoked multiple times by parent module by either repeating module block or using count or for_each meta arguments
    - Flow of information between modules are controlled through input variables and output values
    - Logical reason for creating modules - Promote code reuse
    - How can we get hold of modules?
        - We can create them locally in our file system/source control repository
        - OR remote registry that follows Hashicorp provider protocol
        - Common source - [Terraform public registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules)
        - Modules on registry are versioned the same way the providers are versioned
    - Terraform init - Downloads module from registry to working directory
    - Modules inherit defined providers
    - The only way for parent module to pass information to child module is through Input variables
    - Child module has no access to local values, resource attributes OR input variable of parent module
    - Vice-versa - Parent module has no access to local values, data sources and resource attributes of child module
    - Only way to pass information back to parent module is through output values
    - Consider a module as a Black Box with well-defined inputs and outputs
